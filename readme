=================================================
Test Code for DBI Project #3 - Sorted File Driver
=================================================

1. What files are there in the package?
   	main.cc
	defs
	cat1
	TestAll.sh

2. How to test it?

	Incorporate main.cc in your Makefile. (Note:
	main.cc has main function in it, so you may want to take out your main 
	function). After you do make,you have to supply test number from 1 to 20 
	for testing. The usage is:
		./[Executable-Name] [Test-case# b/w 1-20]

NOTE:
-----
* Timing information is recorded for Test 16 and Test 20
* It is important that you select appropriate file path for the test data files.
* When you run the same test case again and again (for testing reasons) make sure you 
  remove old files created from its last run

3. What to turn-in?

	When its time for you to print the results of all test cases, you may use
	the script "TestAll.sh". Redirect its output to a file.

	The usage of the script is:
		./TestAll.sh [Executable-Name] >& printMe.txt
